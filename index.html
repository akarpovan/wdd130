        <p>Hello! My name is Anna Karpova de Nuñez, and I am from Lima, Perú. I enjoy playing volleyball, growing
            plants, listening to music, and cooking. My hobby is embroidering in cross-stitch because it is easy and
            relaxing.</p>

        <p>Machu Picchu is an Inca citadel located high in the Andes Mountains in Peru, above the Urubamba River Valley.
            Built in the 15th century and later abandoned, it is famous for its sophisticated dry-stone walls, which
            combine enormous blocks without mortar; its fascinating buildings linked to astronomical alignments; and its
            panoramic views.</p>
